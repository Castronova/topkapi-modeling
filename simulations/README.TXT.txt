TEST SIMULATION1		This is the test simulation that I have been doing. All the files like 
				run.py, create_file.py, TOPKAPI.ini, and the TIFFs are included here.
				 Although its name is simulation1, there are more than one simulation here.
				 This is determined by specifying different sets of input files created.
